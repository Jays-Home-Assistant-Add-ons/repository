Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## About

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTPS API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on runs the InfluxDB v2.x build channel. \
